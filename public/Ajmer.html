    <p>
        Ajmer, a city nestled in a valley surrounded by the ancient Aravalli Range in Rajasthan, is known for its rich history and heritage. Founded in the 7th century A.D. by Raja Ajay Pal Chauhan, the city was originally named "Ajaymeru," meaning the 'Invincible Mountain.' The city grew to prominence with the construction of the Taragarh Fort, which played a key role in its strategic importance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over centuries, Ajmer was a center of power, first under the Chauhans, and later under the Afghans and the Mughals. Emperor Akbar declared it a province in 1556 A.D., making it a hub for Mughal operations in Rajasthan. The city's historical significance is further enhanced by its association with the Scindias of Gwalior and British colonial influences, which led to the establishment of top educational institutions such as Mayo College and King George Military School.
