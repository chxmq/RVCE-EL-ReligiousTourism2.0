    <p>
        The <span class="highlight">Golden Temple</span>, also known as <span class="highlight">Shri Harmandir Sahib</span>, is one of the holiest and most iconic places of worship in India. Located in the city of Amritsar, this stunning temple is surrounded by a serene lake with crystal-clear waters, reflecting its golden structure. The temple is covered in over 750 kg of pure gold, giving it a radiant glow, which makes it a popular destination for pilgrims and tourists alike.
    </p>
    <p>
        Erected in 1574 by Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru, it has since become a symbol of peace, harmony, and spiritual solace. Visitors from all walks of life come to this sacred place to experience its tranquil atmosphere and to engage in prayers and meditation.

    <p>
        The history of <span class="highlight">Golden Temple</span> dates back to the time of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, who granted land for the construction of the temple to Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru. The construction began in 1577 and was completed in 1604, with the installation of the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism. The fifth Guru, Guru Arjan Dev, oversaw the installation of the scripture and appointed Baba Buddha as the caretaker of the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
        The templeâ€™s history has been shaped by several significant events, including the 1830 restoration funded by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after the temple was attacked by Afghan invaders. In 1984, the Golden Temple became a focal point during Operation Blue Star, when the Indian army stormed the temple to remove armed militants. The operation resulted in a tragic loss of life and remains a significant moment in the temple's history.
    </p>

    <h3 id="cultural">Cultural Activities at Golden Temple</h3>
    <p>
        The Golden Temple is not just a place of worship but also a center for cultural and religious activities. Devotees engage in prayers, meditations, and participate in the continuous recitation of the <span class="highlight">Guru Granth Sahib</span>, the holy scripture of Sikhism. The temple is open 24/7, and visitors can witness the recitations and experience the soothing sounds of hymns at all times of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="highlight">Langar</span>, or community kitchen, is another key cultural aspect of the Golden Temple. Volunteers serve free meals to thousands of people every day, irrespective of their religion, caste, or background. This practice represents the Sikh principles of selfless service and equality.
    </p>
