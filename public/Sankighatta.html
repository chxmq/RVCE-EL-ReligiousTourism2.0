    <p>
        The <span class="highlight">Dallina Vardamana Mahaveera Jain Temple</span>, located in Sankighatta, Karnataka, is one of the most significant Jain temples in the state. This temple is dedicated to the <span class="highlight">24th Tirthankara, Lord Mahavir Bhagwan</span>, and holds deep religious and historical significance for followers of Jainism. Sankighatta, known for its rich Jain heritage, is home to many other temples and pilgrimage sites.
    </p>

    <h3 id="history">History of the Temple</h3>
    <p>
        The origins of this temple date back to the <span class="highlight">11th century</span>, during the reign of <span class="highlight">Emperor Narasimha I</span> of the Hoysala Dynasty. The emperor built this temple as a place of worship for Jain followers. The Settru family, the original patrons of the temple, took over its management and have preserved its traditions for generations. In 1950, the care of the temple was transferred to the Tahsildar of Magadi Taluk, but the Settru family's legacy continues.

    <h3 id="architecture">Architecture of the Temple</h3>
    <p>
        The temple is home to a unique statue of <span class="highlight">Lord Mahavir</span>, made of <span class="highlight">panchaloha</span> (five metals). This idol is notable for depicting Mahavir as a young boy with a smiling face, exuding warmth and tranquility. The idol was originally carved from black stone, but over time, it was replaced with the current metal idol due to damage. However, the original black stone idol is still present behind the new metal one, adding to the temple's historical and spiritual charm.

This festival coincides with <span class="highlight">Karthika Amavasi</span>, an auspicious day in Hinduism. It marks the day of <span class="highlight">Mahavir Swamy Moksha Kalyana</span>, the liberation of Lord Mahavir. The temple is beautifully decorated, and devotees from far and wide participate in prayers, rituals, and cultural activities.
