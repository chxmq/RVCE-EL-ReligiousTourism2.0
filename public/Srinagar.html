    <p>
        Hazratbal Shrine, located in Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir, is one of the holiest places in Kashmir. It is known for preserving a hair strand of Prophet Muhammad, which is referred to as <span class="highlight">Moi-e-Muqaddas</span> or 'the relic.' The word "Hazrat" means holy or respected, and "Bal" stands for place, making it a 'holy place' for Muslims and a significant site for tourists visiting Srinagar.
    </p>
    <p>
        The relic is displayed to the public on certain occasions such as the birthday of Prophet Muhammad and his four main companions: Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddique, Hazrat Umar ibn Khattab, Hazrat Usman ibn Affan, and Hazrat Ali. These events draw devotees from across the country who come to pay their respects.

    <p>
        The relic was brought to India by Syed Abdullah, believed to be a descendant of Prophet Muhammad. His son, Syed Hamid, inherited the relic but was unable to care for it. He sold it to a wealthy Kashmiri businessman, Khwaja Nur-ud-din Eshai, during the reign of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Upon hearing about the relic, Aurangzeb ordered its seizure and imprisoned Khwaja Nur-ud-din Eshai.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1700, the relic was returned to Kashmir with the deceased body of Khwaja Nur-ud-din Eshai, who died in imprisonment. His daughter, Inayat Begum, became the official custodian of the relic and established the shrine. Today, the Banday Family has taken over the responsibility of maintaining the shrine.
    </p>

    <h3 id="architecture">Architecture of Hazratbal Shrine</h3>

The dome and minaret are heavily influenced by Mughal architecture, while the intricate details and design elements reflect Kashmiri traditions. Its serene location on the northern banks of Dal Lake adds to its beauty, making it one of the most visited places in Srinagar.
